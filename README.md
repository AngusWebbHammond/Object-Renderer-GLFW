# Object Renderer

The aim of this project is to build a renderer with glfw, meant to learn how to use OpenGL and other tools for this.

## How to use

Currently this only works with the Windows WSVC compiler, to run this project clone it from this repo, then setup your run/debug for c++ to be using the correct compiler. Then build with cmake, and run.

## Current Features

- Rendering of 3D objects from file.
- Utilistion of GLSL Shaders.
- Basic motion from the GLM library.
- Movement of the light sources to show the mesh best off.
- Supports thousands of triangles.
- Camera control.

## Planned Features

- Other Shaders.

I would like to eventually integrate vulkan into this renderer.
